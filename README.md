# Ontario-City-Names
Adds the names of Ontarion cities and towns to OpenTTD

## Compiling

To compile this you'll need to install the NML compiler. Installation instructions can be found on the [Transport Tycoon Wiki](https://www.tt-wiki.net/wiki/NMLTutorial/Installation).

After installing NML according to your operation system you can compile the grf using the `nmlc` command like so:

    nmlc -c --grf Ontario-Town-Names.grf ONNames.nml
    
Then put the resulting grf file into the appropriate directory, on Windows it's ~\Documents\OpenTTD\content_download\newgrf
